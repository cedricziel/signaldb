# SignalDB Flight Communication Design

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for Apache Arrow Flight as the primary communication mechanism in SignalDB, both for inter-service communication and external client access. The design leverages the performance benefits of Arrow Flight while maintaining compatibility with the current architecture.

**Current Implementation Status**: ✅ **Complete** - Full Flight communication with WAL integration is implemented and production-ready. All integration tests passing.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Current Architecture

SignalDB currently uses:
- **Apache Arrow Flight** as the primary inter-service communication mechanism ✅ **Implemented**
- OTLP data received via gRPC and HTTP at the Acceptor
- Direct Flight communication between Acceptor and Writer
- Direct Flight communication between Router and Querier
- Object storage integration for Parquet persistence

**Current architecture with WAL integration:**

```
External Clients
      │
      ▼ (OTLP/gRPC)
┌─────────────┐    ┌──────┐  Flight  ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Acceptor  │───▶│ WAL  │────────▶│    Writer   │───▶│   Storage   │
└─────────────┘    └──────┘          └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
     (OTLP)        (Disk)     (Flight)       (Parquet)
                                                  │
                                                  ▼
┌─────────────┐    HTTP   ┌─────────────┐  Flight  ┌─────────────┐
│   Clients   │◀─────────│    Router   │───────▶│   Querier   │
└─────────────┘   (Tempo)  └─────────────┘ (DataFusion) └─────────────┘
```

**What's Working (✅ Complete):**
1. OTLP clients send telemetry data to the Acceptor
2. Acceptor writes data to WAL for durability, then converts OTLP to Arrow format
3. Acceptor forwards data to Writer via Flight (with Storage capability routing)
4. Writer receives Arrow data and persists to Parquet storage
5. Writer marks WAL entries as processed after successful storage
6. Router exposes HTTP endpoints (Tempo API) and forwards queries via Flight
7. Querier executes DataFusion queries against Parquet storage
8. All services discover each other via catalog-based service registry

### 2.2 Apache Arrow Flight

Apache Arrow Flight is a high-performance client-server framework designed for efficient transfer of large datasets over network interfaces.

Key benefits include:
- Native Arrow format transfer (no serialization/deserialization overhead)
- High throughput, low latency data transfer
- Streaming capabilities
- Built on gRPC with authentication and encryption support

## 3. Design Goals

1. ✅ **Achieved**: Improve performance of data transfer between components
2. ✅ **Achieved**: Provide a high-performance query interface for external clients
3. ✅ **Achieved**: Maintain logical separation of components while supporting monolithic deployment
4. ✅ **Achieved**: Eliminate the need for a separate message bus
5. ✅ **Achieved**: Support both in-process and networked communication with the same code
6. ✅ **Achieved**: Implement WAL-based durability with automatic recovery
7. ✅ **Achieved**: Provide capability-based service discovery and routing

## 4. Flight Integration Design

### 4.1 Current Implementation

The current architecture uses Flight as the primary data transfer mechanism:

```
External Clients
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Acceptor  │───▶│    Writer   │───▶│   Storage   │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
                                            │
                                            ▼
                                      ┌─────────────┐
│   Clients   │◀─────────────────────│   Router    │───▶│   Querier   │
└─────────────┘                      └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

All data-intensive communication between components uses Flight.

### 4.2 Component Flight Services ✅ **Implemented**

Each component implements a Flight service:

- **AcceptorFlightService**: Not exposed externally; forwards data to Writer via Flight client
- **WriterFlightService**: Receives data from Acceptor and writes to storage
- **QuerierFlightService**: Executes queries against storage and returns results
- **RouterFlightService**: Exposes HTTP API and forwards requests to Querier via Flight

### 4.3 External Flight Interface

The Router exposes Flight capabilities via HTTP endpoints, providing:
- Query execution via Tempo-compatible API
- Trace retrieval and search functionality
- Administrative operations

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Current Data Flow ✅ **Working**

#### Trace Ingestion Flow:
1. Acceptor receives OTLP trace data via gRPC
2. Acceptor writes data to WAL for durability (fsync to disk)
3. Acceptor converts OTLP to Arrow format using `otlp_traces_to_arrow`
4. Acceptor uses Flight `DoPut` to send Arrow data to Writer (Storage capability)
5. Writer persists data to Parquet storage via object_store
6. Writer confirms successful storage
7. Acceptor marks WAL entry as processed

#### Query Flow:
1. Client sends HTTP query to Router
2. Router forwards query to Querier via Flight
3. Querier executes query using DataFusion against Parquet files
4. Results streamed back to client via Flight → HTTP

### 5.2 Schema Design ✅ **Implemented**

Flight schemas are defined in `src/common/flight/schema.rs` with conversions for:
- OTLP traces → Arrow schema
- OTLP metrics → Arrow schema
- OTLP logs → Arrow schema

### 5.3 Service Discovery Integration ✅ **Implemented**

Components discover each other via:
- **Catalog-based service registry** with PostgreSQL/SQLite backend
- **ServiceBootstrap pattern** for automatic registration on startup
- **Capability-based routing** (TraceIngestion, Storage, QueryExecution, Routing)
- **Heartbeat monitoring** with automatic TTL-based cleanup
- **Flight endpoint discovery** with connection pooling

## 6. WAL Integration ✅ **Implemented**

Write-Ahead Log provides durability and crash recovery capabilities:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Acceptor  │───▶│     WAL     │───▶│    Writer   │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

#### Implemented WAL Features:
1. ✅ **Durability**: Write incoming data to WAL before acknowledgment
2. ✅ **Recovery**: Automatic replay of unprocessed entries on restart
3. ✅ **Batching**: Efficient batch processing with configurable flush policies
4. ✅ **Entry Tracking**: WAL entries marked as processed after successful storage
5. ✅ **Configurable Storage**: Persistent WAL directories with segment rotation

#### Future WAL Enhancements:
1. **Compression**: WAL segment compression for storage efficiency
2. **Replication**: WAL replication for high availability
3. **Retention Policies**: Automatic cleanup of old WAL segments

### 6.2 Enhanced Buffering

For handling backpressure and improving performance:
- In-memory buffering in Writer before Parquet persistence
- Configurable flush policies (size, time, or count-based)
- Real-time query support for buffered data

### 6.3 Multi-Writer Replication

For high availability:
- Hash-based data distribution across multiple Writers
- Replication factor configuration
- Automatic failover handling

## 7. Monolithic Binary Implementation ✅ **Current**

The current monolithic binary (`cargo run`) starts all services in a single process:
- Services communicate via Flight using localhost endpoints
- Automatic service discovery via catalog
- Single configuration file for all components

## 8. Client SDK Integration

Flight communication enables:
- High-performance data transfer
- Streaming query results
- Native Arrow format support
- gRPC-based transport with authentication
